# React using Webpack & Babel Tutorial(s)

## React
- JavaScript framework for creating user interfaces.(library)
- used for SPA
- Component based (HTML written in component files)
- Fast

- [x] React written with JSX & ES6 primarily
- [x] We will be using Babel to translate it to vanilla JavaScript
- [x] Use npm to install Babel and React

## Webpack
- [x] Module bundler
- [x] Takes Modules & dependencies and generates static assets

## Babel-loader and it's relationship with React
- [x] JSX - statically-typed, object-oriented programming language designed to run on modern web browsers.
* Faster
* safer - type-safe(errors more likely to be caught during the compiling process due to the fact that it is statically typed)
* easier
- [x] JSX and ES6 work well with react but there syntax is not universally supported across all browsers.
- [x] Use Babel-loader to translate the files before bundling them(when using JSX and ES6 in React code)

## React components
